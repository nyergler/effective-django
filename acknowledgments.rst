It would have been impossible to put *Effective Django* together with
lots and lots of help. Thanks to PyCon_ and PyOhio_ for allowing me to
speak about these topics and develop the material. Thanks to
Eventbrite_ for supporting my work in this area, and generally just
being an awesome place to work.

*Effective Django* would have been opaque, disjointed, and confusing
without feedback and patience from early reviewers: Tamara Chu,
Brandon L. Golm, Jason Herbst, Philip John James, Galen Krumel, Sanby
Lee, Karl Mendes, Nam-Chi Van, Nicole Zuckerman, and Madeline_.

Thanks for reading this far. If you have feedback, comments, or
suggestions, please feel free to email them to me: nathan@yergler.net.
Or find me on `identi.ca`_ or Twitter_ as @nyergler.
